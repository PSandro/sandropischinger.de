  <p id="text">My name is Sandro Pischinger and my passion is technology: Servers, Computers, Coding, DevOps, IT-Security, Cables, Buttons. These words are music to my ears! 
My personal experience and interest in technology has grown for over a decade now - with me just being 19 years old. So naturally I've always been the one to ask when any tech related devices - the computer/TV/projector/speakers - weren't working the way they should. In addition to just using technology, I early began creating and modifying stuff, assembling computers and wiring LAN-networks. 
Having gained a decent knowledge about hardware over the years, I soon started working with software by contributing to OpenSource-Software, creating websites and handy Bash or Python scripts as well as creating applications with other tech enthusiasts at a coding-camp. 
Furthermore I have an insatiable interest in learning new things and working with the latest technology!</p>
